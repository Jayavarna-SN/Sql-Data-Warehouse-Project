# Sql-Data-Warehouse-Project
Building a Modern Warehouse with SQL server , including ETL process ,Data Modeling ,Analysis

Welcome to my **Data Warehouse and Analytics Project repository!** 🚀
This is an end-to-end SQL project I built by following the **Data with Baraa** tutorial series.

The goal of this project is to understand how real-world data warehouses are designed and how raw data is transformed into meaningful business insights. This project helped me practice **SQL, data modeling, ETL, and analytics using a structured industry approach**.
