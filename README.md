# Sql-Data-Warehouse-Project
Building a Modern Warehouse with SQL server , including ETL process ,Data Modeling ,Analysis

Welcome to my **Data Warehouse and Analytics Project repository!** 🚀
This is an end-to-end SQL project I built by following the **Data with Baraa** tutorial series.

The goal of this project is to understand how real-world data warehouses are designed and how raw data is transformed into meaningful business insights. This project helped me practice **SQL, data modeling, ETL, and analytics using a structured industry approach**.

## 🏗️ Data Architecture

This project follows the Medallion Architecture with three layers:

**Bronze → Silver → Gold**

![Data Architecture](https://github.com/Jayavarna-SN/Sql-Data-Warehouse-Project/blob/47556366f88e2838ea41484583c10ddcaf8b2443/DATA%20ARCHITECTURE.png)

**1. Bronze Layer** - Stores raw data directly from CSV files.Data is loaded into SQL Server without any transformation.


**2. Silver Layer** - Cleans and standardizes the data.Removes duplicates, fixes data types, and handles missing values.


**3. Gold Layer** - Contains business-ready data.Data is modeled into fact and dimension tables (star schema).Used for reporting and analysis.
